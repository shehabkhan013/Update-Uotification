This is purely a place for me to play with a WordPress theme... i.e. what 
would a theme look like if you stripped it down to the bare bones minimum 
and then started to build it back up.

I may or may not work on this in any kind of regular fashion... and I
have no idea why anyone would really want to follow or track this.  I'm
just putting it up on Github so that I can have easy access to it from
multiple places.  :-)

It's purely a place for me to play.
